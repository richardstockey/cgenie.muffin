# designing self-restarting ensemble loops...
# begin with n (n<40) directories of cgenie jobs
# supply primary directory to runmuffin-basket-test.sh
# within that, have n (n<40) directories of cgenie jobs
# within those, have user-config files (same number for each directory in theory, might not matter)

# runmuffin-basket.new command should look like
# ./runmuffin-basket.new.sh [email@uni.ac.uk] [primary-directory] [model-years-per-job]

# what shell script will need to do
# - load dependencies
# - read contents of primary directory
# – use this to establish names of recurring jobs (directory called in runmuffin)
# – [all user-configs will have the same name as the recurring jobs, but with a number at the end]
# – identify first job for each of n directories as job in directory with appendix `-1`
# – generate .sbatch file with all initial n jobs in it
# – submit .sbatch file to slurm
# – store job_id of job
# – [this job will be used to set the dependency for the next job with the restarts]
# – then need to begin a loop of restarts.
# - [we will use the slurm dependency `sbatch --dependency=afterok:$job_id job2.sh`]


# version 3 of this script runs stuff in two batches separated by a 6 minute break
# still runs on 40 cores
# just only needs 20 versions of genie...
# NOTE - this only works for 1 run at a time right now (NOT for restarts...)
# 20241021 – runmuffin-basket.new3.sh is renamed to runmuffin-basket.sh for new cgenie fork.
# also redirecting slurm outputs to separate "slurm" folder in home directory rather than cgenie.muffin/genie-main (should have done earlier)
